Hardware: The parts of a computer system that can be kicked. (Jeff Pesis) If builders built buildings the way programmers wrote programs, then the first woodpecker that came along would destroy civilization. (Gerald Weinberg) A good programmer is someone who always looks both ways before crossing a one-way street. (Doug Linder) Programming is like sex. One mistake and you have to support it for the rest of your life. (Michael Sinz)
Any code of your own that you haven’t looked at for six or more months might as well have been written by someone else. (Eagleson’s Law) Computers are useless. They can only give you answers. (Pablo Picasso) A programmer is a person who passes as an exacting expert on the basis of being able to turn out, after innumerable punching, an infinite series of incomprehensive answers calculated with micrometric precisions from vague assumptions based on debatable figures taken from inconclusive documents and carried out on instruments of problematical accuracy by persons of dubious reliability and questionable mentality for the avowed purpose of annoying and confounding a hopelessly defenseless department that was unfortunate enough to ask for the information in the first place. (IEEE Grid newsmagazine) There are only two kinds of programming languages: those people always bitch about and those nobody uses. (Bjarne Stroustrup) Everything that can be invented has been invented. (Charles H. Duell, Commissioner, U.S. Office of Patents, 1899)

Any code of your own that you haven’t looked at for six or more months might as well have been written by someone else. (Eagleson’s Law) Fifty years of programming language research, and we end up with C++? (Richard A. O’Keefe) Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are–by definition–not smart enough to debug it.

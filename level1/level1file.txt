Godfather ipsum dolor sit amet. Never let anyone know what you are thinking. I am sorry. What happened to your father was business. I have much respect for your father. But your father, his thinking is old-fashioned. You must understand why I had to do that. Now let's work through where we go from here. Hey, listen, I want somebody good - and I mean very good - to plant that gun. I don't want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hands, alright? Only don't tell me you're innocent. Because it insults my intelligence and makes me very angry. My father is no different than any powerful man, any man with power, like a president or senator.

It's not personal. It's business. My father's name was Antonio Andolini... and this is for you. That's my family Kay, that's not me. What's the matter with you? Is this what you've become, a Hollywood finocchio who cries like a woman? "Oh, what do I do? What do I do?" What is that nonsense? Ridiculous!

Fredo, you're my older brother, and I love you. But don't ever take sides with anyone against the Family again. Ever. I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse. Very well. You want to do business with me. I will do business with you. What's the matter with you, huh? What am I going to do? Am I going to make that baby an orphan before he's born? Sonny, please don't do anything. Please don't do anything.
